 json-server --watch db.json --port 3000   


Fixed most of the thing we talked about. But I'm having trouble solving this error: 
 Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.

I understand what it's pointing at, and I've tried various solutions, to no end. 

Also, for the regular POST, the auto-generated IDs are appearing at the end of my JSON arrays. Is that normal? I'm use to seeing them at the first index, in our labs.
