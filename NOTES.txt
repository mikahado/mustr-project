Hi Madeline, 

Here's my repo for the Phase-2 project. 

Having trouble clearing one error, still. When I create a new line item, can't seem to get POST to auto-assign an ID to my nested objects (which I could use as a unique key prop). So I'm getting this error:

Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop. Check the render method of `TehMain`.

I know I'm probably just missing something obvious. If you could point me in the right direction, I'd much appreciate it!

A turn-based, collaborative app to guide spontaneous, fearless writing.


Dome is a writing app that makes the first draft easy, fun, and efficient for collaborative writers. 

Spontaneous, fearless. 

How does it work? First, users choose a type: film, commercial, story, poem. Then they choose a method, a program that guides the form of their writing, but keeps the text box ready to fill. The program is turn-based, so after one user writes their piece, they pass it on to the next writer. The benefit of turn-based (as opposed to synchronous writing, like GoogleDocs) is that it works well for democratic collaboration. No one writer can take control of the whole draft until they have completed it. 

For example, take the classic writing game The Exquisite Corpse. (In this app we call it Exquisite Horse). Played with at least 3 authors, the rules are simple. The first author writes a line, then passes it to the second, who writes a following line in response to the first. But when they pass it to the third author, the first line disappears! They must respond ONLY to the previous line. And so it goes on like this, with each turnz the author can only see the line written before them, and not the whole text. This 'blind spot' functions as a catalyst for indeterminism and risk, two elements essential for creative writing. The more authors included, the greater the blind spot. It is best suited for 3-4 authors. 

Dome makes Dome is an app designed for collaborative writers of all kinds to complete projects. It provides the various structure for different writing styles, so you amd your friends domt have to. 

Writing features are turn-based. After you've finished writing your piece, it is saved





This line has no extra magic. 

# Big Head 1 w/ Line >:D

## heading 2 no line but good stuff :D

### heading 3 probaby never worth it >:(
